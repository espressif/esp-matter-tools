### Development Guide

#### Create Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your development dependencies:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install Development Dependencies

Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Enable Development Mode

Development mode allows you to run the latest version of esp-matter-mfg-tool from the repository.
If you are making any changes to the tool then in order to test the changes please follow the below steps.

```
cd tools/mfg_tool
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

This will install esp-matter-mfg-tool's dependencies and create an executable script wrappers in the userâ€™s bin
directory. The wrappers will run the scripts found in the git working directory directly, so any time the working
directory contents change it will pick up the new versions.

### Running Unit Tests

To run the test suite, install test dependencies and execute tests using pytest:

#### Install Test Dependencies

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

#### Run Tests

Recommanded to use log-cli-level=info to see all subtests.

```
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s --log-cli-level=INFO
```

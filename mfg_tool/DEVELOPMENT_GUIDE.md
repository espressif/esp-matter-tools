### Development Guide 

Development mode allows you to run the latest version of esp-matter-mfg-tool from the repository.
If you are making any changes to the tool then in order to test the changes please follow the below steps.

```
cd tools/mfg_tool
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

This will install esp-matter-mfg-tool's dependencies and create an executable script wrappers in the userâ€™s bin
directory. The wrappers will run the scripts found in the git working directory directly, so any time the working
directory contents change it will pick up the new versions.
